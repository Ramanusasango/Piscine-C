# Piscine C
Piscine C: proposed solutions to exercises, projects, rushes and exams for the admission bootcamp

**Remark** All solutions are **wrong**. There are some corner cases which are not covered by the solution. GOOD LUCK in finding and fixing them! You should submit only your own solution to the exercises, otherwise it is considered cheating. Therefore, please do not verbatim-copy others' solutions without understanding them!
